1. Array
    - Rotation
        - Split
        - move 1by1
        - gcd trick
        - reverse swap
        - block swap
        - right rotation
        - search on rotated sorted array
        - search pairs which sum is given in rotated sorted array
        - find max of i*arr[i] with rotation
        - find rotation count
        - find given times rotation applied
        - find maximum of hamming distance of array with rotation operator
        - get array after right rotation applied k-times
        - find element at a given index after interval right rotations applied v1
        - find element at a given index after interval right rotations applied v2
        - find minimum element on rotated sorted array
        - query output which consist of right/left rotation and summing
